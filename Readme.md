# QThang's Broadcast CV
This is my CV for my esports broadcast work. There's nothing much to talk about.

## Dependencies
There's only one dependency for this project, and it's [Typst](https://typst.app/).

To install to Windows, you can use [Winget](https://winget.microsoft.com/) with `winget install --id Typst.Typst`. Windows 10 version 21H2 or higher is required.

If you're on MacOS, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and use `brew install typst`.
***Why?***

Because I'm a Computer Science student, I used to thought about using `LaTEX`, but it's ***very*** complicated for the unexperienced user. Of course, Typst works easily enough, the downside is that their web editor doesn't have a way to upload files, so installing the CLI is the only way.
